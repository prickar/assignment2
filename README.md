## Hangman Game in JavaScript

Welcome to my Hangman game project built with JavaScript! This game demonstrates my early programming skills and creativity in developing an interactive text-based game.


## Introduction

In this project, I've created a Hangman game using JavaScript. The game showcases my understanding of programming logic and interactivity. It offers players a classic word-guessing challenge and gives a glimpse into my early programming journey.

## Game Overview

Hangman is a word-guessing game where players attempt to discover a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. The player wins by correctly guessing the word or loses if the attempts run out.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the game directory in your code editor.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## How to Play

1. Launch the game in your web browser.
2. A hidden word will be chosen for the category.
3. Guess letters one by one using keyboard input.
4. The game will provide feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.
